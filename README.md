So far in this, we have overlooked and practised more on...

💻 basic_javascript

This section introduces the fundamentals of JavaScript, including syntax, variables, arrays, loops, and functions.
Skills learned:

Writing and understanding basic code

Using arrays to store data

Creating loops for repetitive tasks

Manipulating the DOM

Handling user input

Writing reusable functions


🎮 TicTacToe

This project focuses on building a classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
